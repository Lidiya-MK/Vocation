# Vocation

## Project Description

Vocation is a job portal application designed to connect Freelancers and Job-posters. The system is designed so that freelancers are presented with jobs that match their industry. Therefore, upon signing up, a freelancer should get job recommendations relevant to his/her field.  The jobs posted on vocation can be of **Onsite, Remote** or **Hybrid** type. Freelancers can **apply** for jobs and track their **pending** applications form their dashboard with the option to **withdraw** an application. On the other hand, the job-posters can manage their job posts and applicants from their dashboard. Job-posters are provided with features that allow them to **accept** or **reject** applications as well as **view applicant profiles**.
